# SocialNetwork

Internship project that I adapted Springboot into. 

Differences from my HerokuLoginApp project are limited to addition of TestNG and Carina for API testing. That addition broke the Heroku deployment so I removed it and left that repository on its own.

Technologies used in this project include Java, HTML, Springboot, Thymeleaf, MySQL, JDBC, TestNG, and Carina.

Functionality includes creation of new accounts, logging in with accounts, status messages that show you if you had a successful account creation or login, as well as an overall user count.
